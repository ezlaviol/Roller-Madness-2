I. Game Overview
Go through the stage collecting coins and other goodies to progress to the next stage.

II. Gameplay Mechanics
You operate a roller ball, which operates by ball physics. Enemies will destroy your ball and place you back at the start, and after three hits, you'll lose your progress and restart the level.

III. Controls
This game uses WASD and the arrow keys interchangably for cardinal direction movement. Under certain circumstances, you can jump with the spacebar too!

IV. Saving and Loading
The game saves what levels you've visited, so you can visit them again from the main menu. Your progress is lost when transitioning between stages, though.

V. Menus and Screen Descriptions
The "About" button in the menu screen will tell you about this game, including a few tips mentioned here! The "Level Select" button lets you play stages you've already visited. 
And you can pause with the Escape key as well.

VI. Game World
You'll be taken to various locales throughout your journey. Many of them have a few perilous elements sprinkled in.

VII. Levels
There are four levels, each given names in the Level Select.

Welcome 2 Madness is an introductory stage where enemies spawn to chase you and the layout is simple.

Hopping Mad Mummies takes place in ruins, where the orange bounce pads act as ramps for the player to make jumps.

Laserbud Garden is a lush jungle level, with laser-spewing flowerbuds and tight platforming impeding your progress. There's even a checkpoint on this stage!

Bonus Bash is a final, rather simple celebration stage, where you just need to collect coins in a simple pachinko machine. Here lives are recontextualized as chances to nab those coins! You've only got three!

VIII. Characters
You're a simple rolling ball with a colorful trail behind you. Your trail will change color under certain circumstances...
IX. Non-player Characters
Outside of enemies, there are none.

X. Enemies
Three enemies exist in this game. The Fire Monsters, which float after you, the Hopping Mummies, which chase you in leaps, and the Laserbuds, which fire dangerous lasers!

XI. Weapons
There are no weapons in this game, or really any attacking abilities.

XII. Items
There are coins, which are needed to progress to the next level, and there are food items, which serve the same purpose. The pepper in Laserbud Garden grants you the power to jump, too!

XIII. Abilities
Normally you can only roll around, but with the spicy power of a pepper, you can jump too!

XIV. Vehicles
Unless your rolling ball counts as a vehicle, there are none in this game.

XV. Scripts title name
I custom-coded scripts for a secondary currency, the power-up system, and for the checkpoint system I made. 
These are TreasureAlt.cs, PowerUp.cs, and CheckPoint.cs, respectively.

XVI. Scoring
The score is actively tracked as you play the game. As you need to collect a certain number of coins and other items to progress,
a high score element was not included, since the game automatically stops once you have what you need.

XVII. Puzzle/Mini-Games
The final stage is something of a minigame with its unique structure compared to other levels.

XVIII. Bonuses
The final stage, Bonus Bash, is a bonus level meant to celebrate the game! Complete it to see a special message at the end!

XIX. Cheat codes
There are no cheat codes. Just enjoy the game how it was intended to be played!

XX. Future Features
While I have no future plans to make a Roller Madness 3, perhaps more power-ups, enemies, and levels would be nice!
Maybe even a boss enemy could be implemented... and attack moves for your ball, to boot!
